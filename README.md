# IoT Sentinel: Intelligent Detection of Cyber Threats in Smart Devices

# Project Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent system capable of detecting abnormal behaviors in IoT network traffic using 
machine learning technique 
By analyzing real network data from various IoT devices, the system automatically distinguishes between normal and malicious activities, helping improve IoT security and identify emerging cyber threats early.

# Objectives
- Build a machine learning-based system for anomaly detection in IoT network traffic.  
- Distinguish automatically between normal and suspicious network behavior.  
- Detect unknown or emerging attacks that traditional security tools may fail to recognize.  
- Enhance IoT security by enabling faster and more accurate threat detection.

# Dataset Information
- Dataset Name: CIC IoT 2023  
- Source: Kaggle  
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akashdogra/cic-iot-2023/data  
- Description:  
  The dataset contains real network traffic from IoT devices under both normal and attack scenarios.  
  It includes ~47 features such as flow duration, packet rate, protocol type, header length, and TCP flags.  
  It also provides labeled samples for attacks like **DDoS**, **DoS**, and **Mirai botnet**, alongside normal traffic.  
- Relevance:  
  The dataset provides realistic and labeled IoT traffic essential for training and evaluating an intelligent anomaly detection model.
